Features

    Realistic movement of ships
    Realistic turning
    Ships take damage from accidents
    Speed, acceleration, and turning depends on its size and sails
    Realistic takelage of ship
    Pumps (fast drain of water)
    Fast quenching of fire
    Climbing
    Small protection in shipyards
    Realistic fire: blocks burns for a longer time, and rain doesn't quench fire. It's made for removing broken masts from the game and for the smooth burning of everything. Otherwise ships may burn quickly

Warning

If you see messages like "no ship detected", know: You have to stay on ship in moment of moving to be part of the crew of the ship! Otherwise the ship won't add you to the crew!

If you fell out off your ship, know: you were not on the ship or you tripped and fell off. You have to sneak to hold on unstable place, like a mast or the edge of the ship.

Redstone don't moves!

All inventory blocks don't moves (you can only use it while ship is staying) ! But you can to use vaults or minecart chests.

If your configuration file doesn't works, just copy default configuration
