Warning

If you see messages like "no ship detected", know: You have to stay on ship in moment of moving to be part of the crew of the ship! Otherwise the ship won't add you to the crew!

If you fell out off your ship, know: you were not on the ship or you tripped and fell off. You have to sneak to hold on unstable place, like a mast or the edge of the ship.

Redstone don't moves!

All inventory blocks don't moves (you can only use it while ship is staying) ! But you can to use vaults or minecart chests.

If your configuration file doesn't works, just copy default configuration
